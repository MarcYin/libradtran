# The test compares the 4th and 5th column of mc.is.spc, corresponding to 
# the total radiance I and the polarization difference Q.

# Be careful with the results when using mc_spectral_is. The spectrum looks smooth but it
# has a bias. Please run the simulations several times to find out the accurracy of your
# resulting spectrum.
