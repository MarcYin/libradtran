# Input file to test the uvspec implementation of the Fu and Liou code

#          lband6a (T -> F), 
#          lchou   (T -> F), 
#          SZA (0.5 -> 0.8660425),
#          ispec (4 -> 1),

# remove '| grep Flx1'; the spectral direct and diffuse surface flux is then stored 
# in fort.22. Direct surface flux calculated by the original fu0300b.tar.gz code 
# and by uvspec agree over the first 5 digits!
