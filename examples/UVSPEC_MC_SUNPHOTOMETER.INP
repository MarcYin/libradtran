# Calculates the mean radiance of a sun photometer pointed at the sun at 550 nm.
# Multiply by solid angle covered by detector to obtain irradiance, in this case
# by 2*pi* ( cos(0.0deg) - cos(1.0deg) )

### define detector
# Align detector to the sun
mc_panorama_alignment sun

# Define number of pixels of the detector, in this case only 1 
#              nx  ny  dx    dy [km]
mc_sample_grid  1  1                  

# Detector extent. Circular field of fiew (0..360deg.) ranging from the sun center (180deg) to 1deg distance from the sun center (179 deg)
mc_panorama_view 0 360 179 180 

# Distribute backward photons over the detector field of view
mc_panorama distr_photons_over_pixel

# Use circumsolar variance reduction methods
# Requires VROOM -> Works only if forward peaked phase functions (aerosol/clouds) are present.
# Use only if detector field of fiew is at least 2x sun radius
mc_panorama circumsolar_var_red

# Include direct radiance in the result
mc_panorama with_direct_rad

# Output is weighted with the cosine of the angle between photon and zenith of camera;
# that is, the detector is asumed to be a flat surface normal to the direction to the sun.

### which pixels to calculate. In this case pixel 0 to 0 in azimuthal direction and 0 to 0 elevation direction
