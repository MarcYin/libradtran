# Due to the computational time of the raman option, 
# this is not a realistic example. To turn it in to a
# realistic example you may do as follows:
#
#  * Most filling-in factors are calculated for radiances.
#    To calculate radiances use the umu (and phi) option(s). This
#    will automatically set "number_of_streams 16", thus increasing the 
#    computational time significantly. But we want accurate
#    answers. Don't we?
#
#  * You are probably doing this calculation for a instrument.
#    Hence, you must account for the spectral resolution of the
#    instrument. This is done either by convolving the 
#    extraterrestrial spectrum with your slit function before
#    calling uvspec (fast, but slightly inaccurate), or by calculating
#    the filling-in spectrum and convolving with the slit function
#    afterwards. Slow, but accurate. Do not use the spline option.
